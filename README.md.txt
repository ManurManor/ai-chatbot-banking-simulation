# AI Chatbot Adoption in Banking Customer Service

## Project Overview
This repository contains the simulation model developed for a postgraduate dissertation examining the impact of AI chatbot adoption on customer service performance in retail banking.

The study uses discrete-event simulation to evaluate how different levels of chatbot integration influence key performance metrics such as customer waiting time, agent utilisation, and service efficiency.

## Methodology Summary
The simulation model represents a traditional bank customer service system where incoming customer enquiries are routed either to AI chatbots or human agents based on predefined adoption scenarios.

Customer arrivals are modelled using a Poisson process, while service times follow exponential distributions. Multiple simulation runs are conducted to ensure robustness and reliability of results.
